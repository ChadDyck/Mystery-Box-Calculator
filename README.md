## How does it work?

First we select your desired Mystery Box from the list to set it as the active option.

Now that the chosen Mystery Box is selected, you can begin selecting the items you desire from the list of available MTX for that box.

Once you finish selecting all of the items you hope to get, you enter the number of boxes you plan to open.

After running the simulator, you are presented with a list. These are the items that the box rolled, seperated by the wanted and unwanted. This is the information you use to decide whether or not you want to pay real money for a chance at these items. I strongly suggest running the simulation multiple times to most accurately assess how likely you are to have a positive or negative outcome.

If you so choose, you can then submit your simulated items to the list of global statistics, and see how your preferences stack up against other players!
